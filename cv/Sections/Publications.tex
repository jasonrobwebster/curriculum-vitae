	\textsc{Apr 2019} & Coiling free electron matter waves \\
	& \small{J Pierce, \textbf{J Webster}, H Larocque, E Karimi, B McMorran, A Forbes, \emph{New Journal of Physics 21 (4), 043018}} \\
	& \footnotesize{Demonstrated the construction of a novel class of angularly accelerating electron beams. Provided the means to construct the beam, while my collaborators performed the experiment. Contributed to the theoretical analysis of the electromagnetic field during the electron’s propagation. This paper was based on work from my Honours thesis.} \\

	& \small{\textbf{J Webster}, M Kastner, \emph{Journal of Statistical Physics 171.3 (2018): 449-461}} \\
	& \footnotesize{Studied a highly constrained long-range spin model for use in a specially prepared Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Resulted from the work done during my internship at NITheP.} \\
